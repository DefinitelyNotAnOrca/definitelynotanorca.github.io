## Transparent, Fair Pricing for Quality Service

At Adventyr, our main Priority is getting your appliances back in order, whether that is getting a simple repair, a full rebuild of a machine, or in some cases a recommendation of a new machine.

### Service Call & Diagnostic Fee

**FREE Phone consulation**
If your machine is acting up, please give us a call. If it is possible for us to give you the advice (or simple instructions) to fix your machine, we are more than happy to give that over the phone. Also, if we can detrmine that the Service call would be a waste of your money (IE, spending $200 to fix a $300 machine), we also will give that advice over the phone.
